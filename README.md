# My Waybar theme

![screenshot](./images/preview.png)

WIP
Still need to change some things like power menu button and add more features.
If you don't want to change any line of code, here are the requirements:
- Hyprland
- [Waybar-Cava](https://github.com/ray-pH/waybar-cava)
- nmtui (Network Manager TUI)
- WLogout

Otherwise, you can edit it yourself and get rid of anything you don't want.
